## Music
I love listening to music and it is one of the things that keeps me in equilibrium. I mostly listem to Metal and Rock. However, sometimes I indulge in some India/Alt as well.
### Here are some of my Spotify playlists that I play frequently:
| Metal | Work in Peace (ProgRock) | Got Djent? (Spotify suggested) | Alternative 10s (Spotify suggested) |
