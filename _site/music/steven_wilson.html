<p><img src="/dsvinod90/pics/steven_wilson.jpeg" alt="Steven Wilson" title="Steven Wilson" /></p>

<p>Everyone has his/her own happy space and I believe that music has the power to invoke that feeling of being in one’s happy place. For me, that place would be floating into the vastness of space. Being a space fanatic, I have always imagined of drifting into space and seeing the magnificent celestial bodies, the galaxies, the nebulas, the supernovas, the neutron stars etc., There is sense of satisfaction when I think of these things and I go into a state of trance as I ponder about the vastness of our universe.</p>

<p>I have been listening to Steven Wilson’s compositions for about a decade now and I am addicted to them. Not a day goes by when I haven’t heard any of his songs. Steven’s music is crafted in such a way that most of his songs instantly teleport me to my happy space and I get lost in my own thoughts. Songs like “Drive Home”, “The same asylum as before”, “Arriving somewhere but not here”, “Anesthetize”, etc, trigger this inner astronaut in me and in no time I am deep in my own thoughts of space and cosmos. The lyrics are very thoughtful and the notes just hit the right spots in you that trigger your best imagination.</p>

<p>Steven is truly a gift to to the world who has introduced us to some of the greatest masterpieces in the field of Progressive Rock. Some of his collaborations with other artists have resulted in extremely beautiful compositions that have been under-rated but are extremely precious. Collaborated bands like “BlackField”, “No Man” and “Storm Corrosion” though have not come up with many albums but the ones that are released are truly brilliant.</p>

<p>Lastly, it goes without saying that “Porcupine Tree” has been the most successful band with Steven at its helm. I cannot think of even one song by PT that is just ordinary. Every song released by that band is a masterpiece in its own way.</p>

<p>Thanks Steven, for introducing the world to your music. I wonder what I would be listening to most of the times if I had not stumbled upon your songs.</p>
